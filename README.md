## What we don't do
We don't track you in any way or form.

**There's only one cookie** - in case you locked your project, a session cookie containing
your session token gets stored. 

**There are no user accounts.** We only require eMail if you opt in for disaster recovery
(if you lost the link to a project) or if you set a deadline - because we notify you
by eMail once the day of the deadline is reached.

**Why eMail?** It's less unique than your phone number and versatile enough
for everyone to have at least one. Feel free to create a specific postbox or 
forwarding to increase your anonymity, we support that.
