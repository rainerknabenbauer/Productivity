### What we don't do
#### General
We don't track you in any way or form.

There's only one cookie - in case you locked your project, a session cookie containing
your session token gets stored. 

There are no user accounts. We only require eMail if you opt in for disaster recovery
(if you lost the link to a project) or if you set a deadline - because we notify you
by eMail once the day of the deadline is reached.

Why eMail you ask? It's less unique than your phone number and versatile enough
for everyone to have at least one. Feel free to create a specific postbox or 
forwarding to increase your anonymity, we support that.

We don't just value your privacy but the privacy of your network, too.
That has practical implications. Here's an example of a feature we didn't implement:  
There's no _contact_ tab on your task details to store personal information - 
like eMail, phone number, address - from any partner or contact related to the task.

Possible solutions to include _contact_ tab:
* Only offer storing of contact data if the project is locked.  
But what happens if you unlock it? Delete the data? Disable the unlock feature? Nah.
  
* Encrypt the contact details.  
Encrypting it makes it useless if you want to import it into your calendar - killing
the most significant benefit for storing it. 
  
We agree. It would be a nice feature to offer. 
We just have not yet found a way to store this data securely - while at the same time maintaining ease of use.


#### GDPR / DSGVO
* Offer a way to create an account. The only 
* Offer a way to add contact details to an event
  
#### Stress management
* Add a specific time for your calendar event. A full day is enough.

### Backlog
* Add full mobile support
